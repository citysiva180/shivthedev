        <p>I humbly welcome you to my site! Here goes my story in Tech...</p>

          {" "}
          I started late in computing. Major reason being that even electricity
          in my village was of rarity. The first time I owned a computer was in
          my 14s. I got a windows xp computer and spend n number of hours
          looking into it. I did not get to start early. I did my first program
          in my college final year. This too, was due campus recruitment. But
          there, I got my inspiration. My first sucessful program which was to
          factorize a quadratic equation. What took me ages to calculate and
          compile took seconds to program its logic. It not only simplified my
          problems over the hour, It gave me a confidence that I too could
          program. There I started my journey. After hours and hours of trials
          and errors I learnt all creamy layers of tech, HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript and then non creamy layers, Linux commands, deployments and
          networks etc. The more I was in this, the more I wanted to move
          forward. At times I appreciate that I get to start late cause by the
          time I started, I had clear Idea what I should do and not do. This is
          my story in tech.
